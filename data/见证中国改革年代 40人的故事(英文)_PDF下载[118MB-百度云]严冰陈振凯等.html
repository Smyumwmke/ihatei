Instead, Xu constantly adapted himself to the constantly upgrading locomotive equipment and the new environment and was always prepared to acquire new skills. The sweat and tears Xu shed in pursuit of his dream, nurtured him into a future all-round driver.　　In 1973, Xu, at the age of 24, was transferred to Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot as an assistant driver. It was not until then that Xu had had the chance to practice his train driving skills. He drove the domestically manufactured No. 118 "Renmin Hao" （People） steam train carrying tens of thousands of passengers, shuttling between Zhengzhou and Sanmenxia Gorge.　　In the mid-1970s, the Zhengzhou Railway adopted the more efficient internal combustion locomotive for energy-saving purpose, which gave Xu a chance to drive a diesel locomotive for the first time by the end of 1975. Xu then became one of the First "acting drivers" inside Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot, finally settling in the driving seat.　　With steam locomotives replaced by diesel ones, the work of train drivers also experienced drastic changes. The crew compartment onboard became brighter and more spacious, giving driver a wider view while operating the train. Fireman was no longer needed as there was no furnace to shovel coal and add water into. But Xu was soon faced with a new challenge-how to familiarize himself with the internal combustion locomotive both inside and our. To qualify himself for his role, every day after work, Xu would bury himselfin coundess diesel locomotive textbooks and circuit diagrams-often burning the midnight oil. Before long, Xu had mastered the operation of the diesel locomotive as well as its principles, plus the skills to handle common failures or mishaps with high proficiency.　　China's reform and opening up policy in 1990 provided the soil for the burgeoning of the country's railway industry. Even though Xu was already 41 years old back then, age didn't stop him from elevating himself and becoming an electric locomotive driver.　　That very same year, Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot was electrified, enabling the use of electrically powered "Shaoshan" Model locomotive on the Beijing- Guangzhou Railway. The railway was also upgraded into seamless steel rail, drastically reducing any noise or jolting during operation and thus improving passenger experience. At the time, Xu served as the Director of the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot. To familiarize himself with his job, he used to accompany his train drivers on their journeys, whereby he would acquire new skills and even obtain his license for driving electric trains. He also tried to drive the train himself during test runs to check its performance levels. Xu marveled, "when I was still a driver on diesel train, the engine roared so loud that I fell like I was going to be deafened by it. And the interior of the carriages also looked oily and black because of the fuel. The new electric train runs smoother, doesn't malfunction all the time and is much quieter! The carriage also looks neat and tidy; and it actually pleases the eyes."　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>2018年是中国实行改革开放40周年，值此改革开放40周年之际，本书稿的编者放眼中国社会，在不同的领域选取了40位有鲜明特点和代表性的中国人，在他们当中，有锐意革新的政治家，有政绩突出、和蔼可亲、风趣幽默的官员，有家庭、事业稳定有成的中产，有IT行业的精英，有新兴行业的先行者，比如电商，比如淘宝店主，有抢占商机的成功人士，也有闯天下、谋发展、追逐梦想的打工者。可以说人物的选取囊括了现今社会的多样化阶层。这其中有精英、有草根、有工人、有农民、有学生、有教授……有形形色色的中国人。这些人的共同点是他们都在改革开放的浪潮中凭借着自身的努力不懈奋斗，在奋斗的过程中，他们得到了奋斗感、获得感。将这40人的故事组合在一起，恰好是用每个人的故事多方面、多角度全面地向靠前和靠前社会真实又生动地讲述了中国改革开放政策是如何践行的、中国的老百姓是怎么样在改革开放的政策指引下过上美好生活、真切享受到了改革红利的故事。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　严冰，人民日报海外版记者部主任、高级记者。作品曾获“关注森林奖”等新闻奖项，率领的团队曾获“全国青年文明号”等命名。　　出版的主要著作：《我当上了列车员》（作者、中国铁道出版社）、《你好，一带一路》（主编、人民出版社）、《学习关键词》（策划、人民出版社）、《犀利的中国》（策划、人民日报出版社）。主要新闻报道：《人民日报》头版头条《大西北再架钢铁道》《大漠风尘别有情》；《人民日报·海外版》头版头条《关山万里走京九》《千秋功业千秋事》《硝烟渐尽思悠远》；《人民日报·海外版》12个整版“微观中国”长篇系列报道。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
