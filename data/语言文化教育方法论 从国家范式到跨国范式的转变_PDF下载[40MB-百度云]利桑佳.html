<p>书名:语言文化教育方法论:从国家范式到跨国范式的转变</p><p>作者:利桑佳</p><p>页数:270</p><p>定价:¥32.0</p><p>出版社:上海外语教育出版社</p><p>出版日期:2013-08-01</p><p>ISBN:9787544635646</p><p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　How can we envisage a new language and culture pedagogy that breaks with the tradition of viewing language as part of a closed national universe of culture， history， people and mentality， and begins to see itself as a field operating in a complex and dynamic world characterised by transnational flows of people， commodities and ideas? Initially， to understand the field and its current challenges， we must understand its history， and the first part of this book contains a critical analysis of the history of the intemational field of culture teaching- the first historical treatment of this field ever written. The next part of the book focuses on how we can build a framework for a new transnational language and culture pedagogy that aims at the education of world citizens whose intercultural competence includes critical multilingual and multicultural awareness in a global perspective.</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　利桑佳（Karen Risager），is Dr. Phil. and Professor in Cultural Encounters at the Department of Culture and Identity， Roskilde University， Denmark.
