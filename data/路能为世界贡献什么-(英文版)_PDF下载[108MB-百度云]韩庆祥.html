Since China’s reform and opening-up, the China’s Road with its remarkable practice has drawn wide attention all over the world. It has become an issue for scholars at home and abroad to describe the contributions of the China’s Road systematically and comprehensively. The book clearly focuses on the China’s Road through which “the subsistence contribution” “the developmental contribution” “the institutional contribution” “the cultural contribution” and “the peace contribution” have been successfully made. And it is based on the Chinese realities with internal logic, profound analysis, powerful arguments and unique perspectives by revealing the historical background and carrying out a comprehensive theoretical interpretation.
