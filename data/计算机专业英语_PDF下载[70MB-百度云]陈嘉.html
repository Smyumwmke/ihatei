  插图：It's hard to assign a worthwhile definition to each type of computer because definitions can getbogged down in potentially confusing technical jargon. Nevertheless, the following definitions cansuffice:1 ） A supercomputer can handle gigantic amounts of scientific computation. It's usuallymaintained in a special room or environment, and may be about 50,000 times faster than a micro-computer. As a user in business, you probably would not have contact with a supercomputer.However, you might if you worked in the areas of defense and weaponry, weather forecasting,scientific research, at one of several large universities, or for the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration.2） A mainframe computer is a large computer, usually housed in a controlled environment,that can support the processing requirements of hundreds or thousands of users and computerprofessionals. If you go to work for an airline, a bank, a large insurance company, a largeaccounting company, a large university, or the Social Security Administration, you will likely havecontact, through your individual workstation, with a mainframe computer.3 ） A minicomputer, also known as a midsize or low-end mainframe computer, is similar to butless powerful than a mainframe computer. It can support 2 to 50 users and computer professionals.Minicomputers and mainframe computers can work much faster than microcomputers and havemuch more storage locations in main memory. Many small and medium-sized companies today useminicomputers, so if you go into the business world, you will have good chances to contact with aminicomputer.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
