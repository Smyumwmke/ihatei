The tall keep watched the deserted water with sightless eyes, through which the daylight shone from wall across to wall, and at its feet the crouching huts of its people were thatchless.  It was the desolation of conquest.  The conquered were dead, or in hiding among the hills.  The spoilers, their havoc wrought, had turned and gone away, with famine spreading wave-like at their heels.　　Far up on the flank of the mountain there fell the distant lowing boom of a bittern.  Some cattle, lost in the waste of thicket at a further height, answered this call as if it came from their kind.　　Three men, sprawled on their bellies in a grassy crevice between the  boulders, had been peering downward upon the picture of ruin below.  They glanced at one another now, with a flash of comprehension.  A little wiser than their kine, they knew that the bittern cried only in the breeding spring-time: and this was the tenth month of the year.  One of them echoed the sound, and when it was repeated, coming nearer, the three dragged them-selves to their feet, andi, stealing upward, stood forth on a ledge of rock in  plain view.  There cjimbed  towards  them presently another, a lean and agile man, whose bare legs brushed through the spikes of furze and heather as if they were cased in hide, and whose naked soles missed no footing on the stones as he bounded from boulder to crag.　　He stood panting before them, and without speech turned to survey the prospect spread beneatb, till his breath could be overtaken. Laoking thus, his rover eye caught something the others had already seen-a small barque, with full sails limply hanging on the still air, down in the misty distance where the great sea ends and Dunmanus begins.   He pointed to it, and nodded his head.　　"It is to Turlogh, son of Fineen, I will be hastening now," he said, with abruptness. "how me the way."　　As the group turned, the foremost of them lifted his head and halted.　　"It is Turlogh who comes to you," he said.　　A few paces away, on the crown of the cliff, stood a man to whom all four bent their heads.   He regarded them with an eye which asked them questions, yet shrank from hearing these if they were to be not to his mind, and they, knowing this well, beld their peace, and looked about them at their ease.　　The Lord of Dunbeekin was an old man now7 tall and slender of frame, with much grey hair flowing upon his rounded shoulders.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《Literature系列：黄面志（第7卷）》为《黄面志》第7卷。《黄面志》一书，美国小说家、编辑哈兰（Henry Harland，1861-1905，）编选。是文学季刊的合印本。原以“黄色年代”为名，自1884年4月创刊到1887年春停刊，共13期。它引领英国19世纪末20世纪初文坛风潮，包含宽广的文化和艺术体裁：诗歌、短片小说、随笔、插图、画像和画作复件。有名英国画家比亚兹莱（Aubrey Beardsley，1872-1898）为其创作了若干期封面。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
