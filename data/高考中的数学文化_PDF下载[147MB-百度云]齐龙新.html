      教育部考试中心以正式文件明确提出在高考数学考题中要体现数学文化，这是一个明显的信号：要求学生加强对数学文化知识的学习，自觉地、有针对性地重视对数学文化修养的提升。
      本书创新性地从“以数化人”与“人数学化”两个角度来谈数学文化，对数学文化在数学历史、数学精神、数学应用、数学之美、数学语言、交汇拓展、数学游戏等各个主题上都作出了全面透彻的剖析和论述。除此之外，作者还结合历年高考数学试题进行具体的案例分析，以此让高考生能够精准消化吸收高考中的各种数学文化知识。
      对高中生而言，这是一部让他们明确数学文化“是什么”“怎么考”“怎么练”，为备考数学文化提供清晰学习方向的红宝书；对数学教学工作者或研究者而言，这是一部系统揭示命制背景、展示解题过程、凸显数学文化价值的宝贵内参书；对于广大的数学文化爱好者而言，这又是一部让人崇尚真理，净化心灵，提升文化修养和文化品格的数学美书。

★现在的高考试题越来越注重考生解决问题的能力，倘若只会刷题而不能理解题中真意将会寸步难行。本书以文化为内核，将理论、方法、历史、文化融为一体，知识性、趣味性和实操性完美结合。
★数学家顾沛高度赞赏的数学文化典范之作，中国科学院院士陈佳洱、王大中联袂诚意推荐，适合高中生及教学工作者使用。 </p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>      齐龙新，北京市数学特级教师，山东省教学能手，山东省新课程研修团队专家，山东省基础教育教师培训专家，山东省优质课一等奖、教育部一师一优课一等奖获得者，现为北京市育英学校经济学实验班班主任。作者致力于“新数学自学辅导教学法”的实践与研究，所编自学教材曾获得山东省优秀课程资源一等奖，在日常教学实践中也取得了非常显著的教学效果。其微信个人公众号“龙新数学(zxfd66)”曾经获得2016年数学文化杂志社主办的携手北大数学文化节最红公众号评选全国第二名。
