The material on dilute polymer solutions, appearing in the later chapters, had to be completely recast and expanded in the face of recent theories and experiments.The book consequently goes considerably beyond the Baker lectures both in scope and in the inclusion of new developments. ...</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
