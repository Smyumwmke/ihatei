   Oliver Twist, Charles
Dickens's second novel, was first published as a serial that began in February
of 1837 and ended in April of 1839. The story is about a child, whose mother
had died, that was sent to a workhouse. Oliver was an innocent and pure boy.
When he was eleven, he was tried to be sold from the workhouse as an
apprentice, but he escaped from there. In his way to London, he met a boy
called Artful Dodger and then ended up with Fagin, the leader of a gang of
thieves, who taught children how to steal. 
   Oliver
Twist
is notable for its unromantic portrayal by Dickens of criminals and their
sordid lives, as well as for exposing the cruel treatment of the many orphans
in London in the mid-19th century. In this early example of the social novel,
Dickens satirizes the hypocrisies of his time, including child labor, the
recruitment of children as criminals, and the presence of street children. It
is likely that Dickens's own youthful experiences contributed.
   Oliver
Twist has
been the subject of numerous adaptations for various media, including a highly
successful musical play, Oliver!, and
the multiple Academy Award-winning 1968 motion picture. Disney also put its
spin on the novel with the animated film in 1988.
