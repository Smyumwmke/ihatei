Regarding the outlook for this new trend, Ibelieved it was the peace and development spoken of by Deng Xiaoping. I also stated this was "a great, historical trend on our winding path of existence."　　In fact, before the 13th CPC Nauonal Congress and during the related preparation and drafting work, I carried out a systematic investigation and work assigned by the CPC Central Committee on the issues of the primary stage of Chinese socialism and socialist market economies. While working on these items, I personally felt the Central Committee's insistence holding to Deng Xiaoping's assessment of peace and development as the theme of the times in handling major international issues and in seizing the opporturuty to bring the economies of China and the world closer together on the foundation of concepts regarding the primary stage of Chinese social/sm and socialist market economy By doing so, China's economic development was greatly promoted. As a theoretiaan for the CPC, I was very excited, and it further cemented my understanding of China's relationship with the international commun/ty.　　After the 14th CPC National Congress in 1992, I held the position of executive deputy head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Comm/ttee, and my main task was to equip the whole Party with Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialism with Chinese characteristics. In September of 1997 before the 15th National Congress, I was made executive vice president of the School of the Central Committee of the CPC （the Central Party School）. During the 15th National Congress, Deng Xiaoping Theory was linked to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as a guiding principle of the Party, and it was written into the Party Constitution. During a speech at the Kennedy School of Harvard in December of the same year, I stated that Chinese people will remember Deng Xiaoping because he is the symbol of the CPC's initial focus on modernization and the beginning of a never-before-seen phase of development, both of which occurred during the reform and opening up as China became linked to economic globaLization instead of economic separatism.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>中国作为崛起中的后起大国，西方既有认同，也有担忧，目前总的情况是担忧大于认同，“中国威胁论”和“中国崩溃论”均有一定市场。针对此，本书全面论述了中国和平崛起道路的由来、根据、内涵与前景，指出了中国和平崛起道路实质就是在以和平与发展为时代主题的条件下，同经济优选化相联系而不是相脱离的进程中，独立自主地建设中国特色社会主义，使中国作为维护世界和平的坚定力量实现崛起。力求让世界全面清晰地了解中国和平发展观的理论内涵，引导靠前主流舆论。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　郑必坚，1932年生，四川富顺人。1952年加入中国***，1954年中国人民大学政治经济学系研究生毕业。历任中共中央文献研究室组长、中共中央书记处研究室室务委员、中共中央***胡耀邦的政治助理、国务院国际问题研究中心副总干事、中国社会科学院副院长兼马列所所长、中其中央宣传部常务副部长、中共中央党校常务副校长、中国改革开放论坛理事长。系中国***第十四届、第十五届中央委员。现任中共中央党校学术委员会主任、国家创新与发展战略研究会会长。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
