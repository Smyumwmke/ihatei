<p>书名:言辞用法研究</p><p>作者:（美）格赖斯（Grice P.)</p><p>页数:403</p><p>定价:¥36.9</p><p>出版社:外语教学与研究出版社</p><p>出版日期:2002-03-01</p><p>ISBN:9787560025803</p><p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>Studies in the Way of Words Paul Grice provided philosophy with crucial ideas.His account of speaker-meaning is the standard that others use to define their own minor divergences or future elaboration.His metaphysical defense of absonlute values is considered the beginning of a new phase n philosophy.Throughout this volume Grice has carefully arranged and framed the sequence of essays to emphasize not a certain set of ideas but a habit of mind,a style of philosophizing.It is a vital book for all who are inteested in Anglo-Amcrican philosophy. <br/>    “Grice was a miniaturist who changed the way other people paint big canvases.The question of correct scale is ultimately one of intellectual judgment,and in his magisterial,fastidious prose rebukes those of us who want to move faster.[His] work culminated in the William James lectures delivered at Harvard in 1967,and philosophers will be grateful for having them finally available in one volume,Studies in the Way of Words,together with many other of Grice's papers,and a retrospective epilogue,written within two years of his death.”<br/><br/> </p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
