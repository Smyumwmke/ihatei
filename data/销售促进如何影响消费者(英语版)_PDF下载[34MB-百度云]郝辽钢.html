　　Sales Promotion is one important marketing strategy. In recent years, sales promotion is getting more and more emphasis, since it is viewed as very effective in stimulating sales by more and more marketers. However, compared with other marketing strategies, there is still a lack in the field of sales promotion, especially the antecedents and consequents of sales promotion. Furthermore, the empirical evidence of Chinese consumers, with respects to their consumption modes and behavioral response process towards sales promotion, is also very rare in current literature. The book incorporates several interesting research papers, which fulfilled the research gaps in the relevant fields and demonstrated the excellent work completed by the author and his research teams.
