<br/>from Nanjing Forestry University (NJFU), Nanjing, P. R. China,Fuliang Cao (English name Sam) receive dhis PhD in Forest Ecol-ogy at the University of British Columbia, Canada, focusing on Ecological Basis for GinkgoAgroforestry. Since 1982 he has been working as one of the faculty member at NJFU, where he presented courses on silviculture, no-wood products, bamboo forests, methodology for no-wood products research.
<br/>    For the past twenty years, Dr. Cao has under- taken many key research projects mainly related to the ecophysiology, forest ecology and silviculture of poplar, bamboo and ginkgo. He has published several books titled as Chinese Ginkgo, Ginkgo, Growth Dy- namics of Southern Poplar Clones, Silviculture and Forest Ecology. Since 1992, his research interests have been focused on ginkgo tree species covering many aspects from genetics to physiology, forest ecology,
<br/>silviculture and utilizations of ginkgo. The forty-three graduate students he has supervised over the past ten years have studied all aspects of Silviculture and some areas of Forest Ecology covering ecophysiology, pro-duction ecology, agroforestry, tree species selection,density control and modelling.
<br/>    Dr Cao is currently professor of Silviculture and vice-President at NJFU and vice-Chairman of ChineseGinkgo Research Institute.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
