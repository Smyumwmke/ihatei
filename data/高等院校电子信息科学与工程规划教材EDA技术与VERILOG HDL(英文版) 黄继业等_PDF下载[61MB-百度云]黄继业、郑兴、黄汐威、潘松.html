《EDA 技术与 Verilog HDL （英文版）》 systematically introduces EDA technology and Verilog HDL. It well combines the basic 
knowledge, programming skills and practical methods of EDA technology and Verilog HDL with the actual 
engineering development technologies. According to the regulations and requirements of the classroom teaching 
and experimental operation in universities and colleges, and with the aim of enhancing the practical engineering 
design ability and independent innovation capability of students, the authors reasonably arrange the content of the 
whole book. The book is divided into seven parts: overview of EDA technology, syntax knowledge and practical 
technology of Verilog HDL, detailed usage of Quartus and IP module, design technology of finite state machine, 
16/32-bit practical CPU design technology and innovative practical project, ModelSim-based Test Bench 
simulation technology and a large number of practical system design examples. Apart from a few chapters and 
sections, most of the chapters arrange the corresponding exercises and a large number of highly targeted 
experiments and design projects. All of the Verilog HDL examples enumerated in the book have passed through 
the compiling or hardware testing. 
《EDA 技术与 Verilog HDL （英文版）》 can be used as the textbook or reference book for the subjects of electronics, computer, and 
automation, and can provide teaching PPT courseware, experimental source programs and demonstration videos 
and so on.
