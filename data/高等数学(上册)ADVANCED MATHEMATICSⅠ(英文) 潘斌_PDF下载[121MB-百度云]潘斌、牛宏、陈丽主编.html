The aim of this book is to meet the requirement of bilingual teaching of
advanced mathematics. The selection of the contents is in accordance with the
fundamental requirements of teaching issued by the Ministry of Education of
China. <br/>
<br/>
Base on the property of our university，we select some
examples about petrochemical industry. These examples may help readers to
understand the application of advanced mathematics in petrochemical industry. <br/>
<br/>
This book is divided into two volumes. This volume contains functions and
limits, calculus of functions of a single variable and differential equation.
Basic concepts in this book are clear and accurate. The book introduce the
fundamental theories by a method that is easy for understanding. <br/>
