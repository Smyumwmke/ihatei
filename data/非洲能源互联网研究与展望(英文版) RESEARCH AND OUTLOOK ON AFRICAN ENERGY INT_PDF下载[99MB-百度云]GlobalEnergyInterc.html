This report is one of the GEI research series. Based on the requirements of sustainable development in Africa, it systematically studies the African Energy Interconnection. It is divided into 7 chapters. In Chapter 1, the development status of the economy, society, resources, environment, energy and power in Africa is introduced. In Chapter 2, the challenges for sustainable development and energy transition in Africa are analyzed and the development concepts for African Energy Interconnection areproposed. In Chapter 3, guided by achieving the 2 ℃ global temperature control target, the development trend for energy and power transition in Africa is envisioned, with corresponding scenarios proposed. In Chapter 4, the distribution of clean energy resources and layout of major power generation bases are studied. In Chapter 5, based on the analysis of the power balance, the overall layout and interconnection schemes for African Energy Interconnection are proposed. In Chapter 6, the comprehensive benefits brought by building African Energy Interconnection are assessed. In Chapter 7, the clean energy and power development path with its scenario in Africa to achieve a targeted 1.5℃ temperature control is envisioned.
