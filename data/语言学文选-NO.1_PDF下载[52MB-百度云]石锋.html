  插图：Abstract: Chinese word classes are prototype categories in nature. Ordinary people tend to group thewords, which share the family resemblances in distribution, into the same class. It is not feasible todivide the word classes by using the conjunctive and disjunctive relations between distributional fea-tures since we might not find a feature exclusively shared by all members of a class. There are typicalmembers and non-typical members in a certain word class. The typical members are the prototypes ofthe class and serve as the standards for the classification of the non-typical member. And the typicalmembers of the same class always share a bundle of distributive features, which could be taken as thebasis to divide and define word classes. Though the typical members of different classes have appar-ent disparities, the non-typical members of different classes only show slight and vague disparities,which has been the origin of the dilemma in Chinese word class dividing. At last, the paper presentsthe advantages of prototype theory in Chinese word class dividing and some other linguistic fields,such as the judgments on the identities of some syntactic constructions, and the classification of dia-lectal regions.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
