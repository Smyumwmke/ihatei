The government appears to go omuch the same，but there is a spoke out of its wheel， nevertheless. I was clerk of theSenate Committee oConchology， and I have throwup the position. Icould see the plainest dispositioothe part of the other members of thegovernment to debar me from having any voice ithe counsels of the na-tion， and so I could no longer hold office and retaimy self-respect. If Iwere to detail all the outrages that were heaped upome during the sixdays that I was connected with the government iaofficial capacity，the narrative would fill a volume. They appointed me clerk of that Com-mittee oConchology and theallowed me no amanuensis to play bil-liards with. I would have borne that， lonesome as it was， if I had metwith that courtesy from the other members of the Cabi which was mydue. But I did not. Whenever I observed that the head of a departmentwas pursuing a wrong course， I laid doweverything and went and triedto set him right， as it was my duty to do； and I never was thanked for itia single instance. I went， with the best intentions ithe world， to theSecretary of the Navy， and said：<br/>　　'Sir， I cannot see that Admiral Farragut is doing anything but skir-mishing around there iEurope， having a sort of piic. Now， that maybe all very well， but it does not exhibit itself to me ithat light. If thereis no fighting for him to do， let him e home. There is no use iamahaving a whole fleet for a pleasure excursion. It is too expensive.Mind， I do not object to pleasure excursions for the naval officers——pleasure excursions that are ireason——pleasure excursions that are eco-nomical. Now， they might go dowthe Mississippi oa raft——'<br/>　　You ought to have heard him storm！ One would have supposed I hadmitted a crime of some kind. But I didn't mind. I said it was cheap，and full of republicasimplicity， and perfectly safe. I said that， for atranquil pleasure excursion， there was nothing equal to a raft.<br/>　　Thethe Secretary of the Navy asked me who I was ； and wheI toldhim I was connected with the government， he wanted to know iwhatcapacity. I said that， without remarking upothe singularity of such aquestion， ing， as it did， from a member of that same government， Iwould inform him that I was clerk of the Senate Committee oConcholo-gy. Thethere was a fine storm！ He finished by ordering me to leave thepremises， and giving my attentiostrictly to my owbusiness ifuture.My first impulse was to get him removed. However， that would harmothers besides himself， and do me no real good， and so I let him stay.</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>《英文全本典藏：马克·吐温短篇小说集（英文版）》收录了马克·吐温短篇小说名篇，这些脍炙人口的短篇佳作，文笔幽默，语言辛辣，尖锐地讽刺和揭露了像瘟疫般盛行于美国的投机、拜金狂热及暗无天日的社会现实。<br/>　　马克·吐温经历了美国从“自由”资本主义到帝国主义的发展过程，其思想和创作也表现为从轻快调笑到辛辣讽刺再到悲观厌世的发展阶段。他的作品文字清新有力，审视角度自然而独特，被视为美国文学史上具划时代意义的现实主义著作。佳作不厌百年读，这些脍炙人口的“美味”可以让人尝鼎一脔。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
