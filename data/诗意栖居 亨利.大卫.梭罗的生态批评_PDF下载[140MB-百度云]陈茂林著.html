Besides, the Indian culture also influenced Thoreau. According to Robert Kuhn McGregor, Thoreau had been showing deep interest in Eastern books since the 1840s. He studied the Bhagvat Greeta during his stay at Walden Pond. In September 1849, he borrowed a two-volume French translation of one of the key works of Hindu religion, the Mahabharata, from the Harvard Library, along with a history of Hindu literature, and examined the Mahabharata——which collected a wide assortment of vedas, prayers, cautionary tales, laws, and other material.
