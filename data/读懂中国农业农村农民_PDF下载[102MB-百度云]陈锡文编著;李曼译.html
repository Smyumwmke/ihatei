China's agricultural civilization and the map of world civilizations　　Mankind has millions of years of history that can be studied. Two and a half million years ago, when human beings were just coming down from the trees and walking on the ground, they subsisted mainly as hunter gatherers. It was not until ten thousand years ago that agriculture emerged to become an important revolutionary power that pushed forward human society. Without any doubt, agriculture is mankind's most important invention to date.　　In the logic of history's course, general trends are more important than details, and tendencies more weighty than specific events. As tegards crucial factors influencing the origin of agriculture, besides the evolution of human cognitive abil/ty, one can point to changes in the general climatic environment, the specificity of particular species such as wheat, rice, and tamable animals growing in particular places, and even the possible beliefs of om: ancestors as playing important roles in the emergence of agriculture, environmental changes probably being the most direct factor. It is generally accepted that, because the most recent glacier recession occurred between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago, man's primitive agriculture emerged during the Neolithic Age of that period （about 5,000 to 10,000 yeafS ago）. The most important symbol of the Neolithic Age is the cultivation of crops, and the development of agricultural production facilitated division of labor in human society, which in turn enabled the rise of aty civilization some 5,000 years after that.　　In human history, the spafks of ancient civilization appeared in quite a few places, yet they died out Of were extinguished one by one　　over the passage of time. Countries in the valleys of the Nile and of the Tigris-Euphrates that first entered the civilization era around 4000 BC followed each othef into decline in 6th and 4th century BC respectively under the impact of foreign invasions. The Dravidian people established the splendid Harappa culture in the Indus Valley around 2500 BC, but had vanished by 1750 BC. After the Aryan invasions of 1000 BC, the In dia region entered a long period of division. Civilizations in the Americas had glorious achievements but later becarrie mired in stagnation.　　China is one of the handful of places where the world's agricultural civilization originated and developed without interruption, which must be counted a miracle in the development of human society. According to the latest archaeological findings, China's history of agriculture can be dated as far back as 10,000 BC, basically around the same historical period as the emergence of agriculture in West Asia. By around 7000-8000 BC it had developed qLute prosperously Some archaeological findings have even challenged the perceived wisdom regarding China's agricultural history. For example, it was assumed that wheat was not produced in China originally but introduced to China from the Western Reg:ions. However, that assumption was overturned with the wheat unearthed at Diaoyutai Village, Haoxian County, Anhui Province, which can be dated back to the Western Zhou Dynasty （1046-771 BC）. The later discovery of 5,OOO-year-old wheat and barley grains at Donghuishan, Minle County, Gansu Province, gave an even earlier date for China's wheat growing history.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>中国是一个农业大国，农业、农村和农民问题一直贯穿着中国历史的发展。新中国成立后，农业、农村和农民问题更是中国共产党和中国政府全部工作中的“重中之重”。读懂中国农业、农村和农民，是读懂中国历史和文化的起点，也是理解当代中国经济社会现状的逻辑原点。本书分四章，分别从悠久的中国农业文明、新中国成立至20世纪80年代对中国农业农村发展道路的艰难探索、改革开放至21世纪初中国农村巨变、新世纪以来中国强农惠农富农政策体系的建立等方面梳理了中国农业在各历史时期的发展、面临的困难及政策举措。全书架构清晰、分析客观、数据翔实、史料丰富，在有限的篇幅内用尽量大众化的语言为读者展现出一幅中国农业发展的长卷。从源头为读者释义中国农业发展的脉络及目前发展状况，解答了中国“三农”问题为何关系国家发展、经历了哪些发展过程及今后如何发展。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　陈锡文，祖籍江苏丹阳，1950年生于上海。现任第十三届全国人民代表大会农业与农村委员会主任委员，中央农村工作领导小组原副组长兼办公室主任。1978年考入中国人民大学农业经济系。毕业后先后在中国社会科学院农业经济研究所、原国务院农村发展研究中心、国务院发展研究中心、中央财经领导小组办公室、中央农村工作领导小组办公室工作。从20世纪80年代初开始，长期从事我国“三农”领域的理论和政策研究工作。参与了1983年以来党中央、国务院指导农村改革发展的大部分重要文件起草工作。作为起草组负责人，参与了2004年至2016年13个中央一号文件的起草工作，参加了党的十七大、十八大报告以及多次中央全会的i决定》《建议》起草工作。在深入调查研究的基础上，对农业与国民经济关系、农村土地制度、农业经营体制、国家粮食安全、农民收入增长、农村工业化、城镇化等问题发表了一系列论著，其与人合著和独著的论著曾4次获得孙冶方经济科学奖。曾被中央党校、国家行政学院聘为特聘教授，被清华大学、中国人民大学、中国农业大学聘为教授和博士生导师。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
