"Was that a gun， Joe?" I asked.　　"Ah， yes!" said Joe. "It means another prisoner has escaped. I heard that one prisoner managed to escape last night."　　"Is it the police that fires the gun?" I asked. I looked at Joe and he shook his head as if to warn me.　　My sister replied by angrily cutting me short，. "Ibo many questions，" she frowned. "If you must know it's those men in the prison-ships who fire the gun."　　I really wanted to know more， so I managed to ask in a quiet way， "I wonder who is in prison-ships， and why?"　　This questioning of mine was too much for Mrs. Joe. "Listen， you! I didn't bring you up by hand to bother people all the time! The river has ships on it that are used as prisons. These places are for thieves and murderers， and they stay on those ships for years sometimes. And when they were little they would ask too many questions! Now， go to bed!"　　I wasn't able to sleep all night. I was afraid of the young man who would take my heart， I was afraid of the stranger with the iron chain， and I was afraid that my sister would later discover that some food had been stolen. As soon as the sky became a little bright outside my window， I got out of bed and quietly went down to the kitchen. I stole some bread and cheese， and a big meat pie. I was hoping that nobody would notice the food that was missing， as there was a lot of food ready for Christmas. I wasn't brave enough to take the whole bottle of wine for that would surely be noticed. So I poured some wine into a smaller bottle and put it in my bag. Then I filled up the big wine bottle with what I thought was water from a big brown bottle. Then I went to Joe's box of tools to find the tool the stranger wanted. When I ran outside， it was still quite dark.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>《远大前程》这部小说情节扣人心弦又感人至深，希望由萌生而至幻灭的过程唤起一代又一代读者的共鸣。善良的匹浦是个孤儿，一天他在教堂墓地遇到一个逃犯，他从家中偷出食物和工具，帮助了逃犯。不久，富有的郝薇香小姐想为其恶毒的爱情游戏寻觅一个男孩，匹浦被选中住在她家，之后爱上了她的养女——骄傲的艾丝黛拉。一天，郝薇香的律师突然前来，告知有个神秘人要把全部财产留给匹浦，匹浦得以到伦敦接受教育，过起了奢靡堕落的生活。在一个风雨交加的夜晚，一位不速之客造访，原来他就是当年匹浦在墓地救济过的逃犯——马格维奇。为报一饭之恩，他把攒起来的钱寄到伦敦培养匹浦。为看一眼自己造就的绅士，他冒险回归，却不幸被捕，死在狱中，财产全部被没收。艾丝黛拉又嫁给了别人。匹浦大病一场，恢复后心灵获得了一种新生。他离开了英国，多年后回国与艾丝黛拉重逢，两人沐浴着朦胧的月色，携手走出已成废墟的郝薇香老宅。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　查尔斯·狄更斯（1812-1870），十九世纪英国批判现实主义小说家。狄更斯特别注意描写生活在英国社会底层的“小人物”的生活遭遇，深刻地反映了当时英国复杂的社会现实，为英国批判现实主义文学的开拓和发展做出了贡献。主要作品有《匹克威克外传》《雾都孤儿》《老古玩店》《艰难时世》《大卫·科波菲尔》等。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
