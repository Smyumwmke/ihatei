  插图：And the China Business News has carried an atypically direct commemary that alleged that the power shortage was caused by government monopolies controlling railways，power plants and the power grid．In an effort to hasten a return to normal，China’S government has managed to persuade nearly half a million travelers to abandon their travel plans for this week’S holiday and accept refunds instead——even though，for many，this will be the only chance they’ll have all year to get home and see their families．Investment Opportunities in the windWe are not SO naive as to suggest that Beijing is turning over a new leaf with regard to a sudden relaxation in media contr01．but the fact that they are allowing normally controversial headlines and stories to appear at a time when tremendous social stress could be setting the stage for more govemment spending as a means of appeasing the restless masses．Assuming we’re right and history suggests that we are，this future outlay could boost China'S gross domestic product(GDP)growth to an even brisker rate than the blistering 1 1．4％they reported for 2007．The fuel：The trillions of dollars that get unleashed as part of the high-visibility programs that are aimed at reducing social unrest even as they upgrade the company'S infrastructure and maximize economic production．And they’II need it．The damage estimate of US$7．5 billion is certain to escalate．And the storm has spotlighted key infrastructure shortcomings that will now have to be addressed．In the past，the spending has been targeted to critical areas such as power production．transportation and construction．This time around，we think it will also include mart reforms that are designed to reduce the odds of the current crisis being repeated．</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
