  《量子场物理学》is intended to provide a general introduction to the physics of quantized fields and many-body physics. It is based on a two-semester sequence of courses taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign at various times between 1985 and 1997. The students taking all or part of the sequence had interests ranging from particle and nuclear theory through quantum optics to condensed matter physics experiment.The book does not cover as much ground as some texts. This is because I have tried to concentrate on the basic conceptual issues that many students find difficult. For a computation-method oriented course an instructor would probably wish to suplement this book with a more comprehensive and specialized text such as Peskin and Schroeder An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory, which is intended for particle theorists, or perhaps the venerable Quantum Theory of Many-Particle Systems by Fetter and Walecka.</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>this book is intended to provide a general introduction to the physics of quantized fields and many-body physics. it is based on a two-semester sequence of courses taught at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign at various times between 1985 and 1997. the students taking all or part of the sequence had interests ranging from particle and nuclear theory through quantum optics to condensed matter physics experiment.<br/>    the book does not cover as much ground as some texts. this is because i have tried to concentrate on the basic conceptual issues that many students find difficult. for a computation-method oriented course an instructor would probably wish to suplement this book with a more comprehensive and specialized text such as peskin and schroeder an introduction to quantum field theory, which is intended for particle theorists, or perhaps the venerable quantum theory of many-particle systems by fetter and walecka.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
