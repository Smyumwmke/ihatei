If his humour first came out of the American frontier, it proved immediately popular with a British audience. When Twain first visited England in August 1872, he was widely f~~ted, and found himself already well-known: 'a lion', 'by long odds the most widely known &amp; popular American author among the English' (L5, 184, 197). Very much at home there, he wrote home to wife Olivia: 'Too much company- too much dining - too much sociability. (But I would rather live in England than America -which is treason.)' (L5, 155). He made his visit in the first place in part to gather material for a book provisionally titled Upon the Oddities and Eccentricities of the English. But the genuine warmth of his reception in the country helped persuade him to abandon this project. And by the end of 1873 he had visited England three times, thoroughly enjoying his reputation there as author, lecturer and wit. Indeed, it would seem that the British public recognised Twain's exceptional comic talents and gave him celebrity status, more quickly than his native audi- ence. Albert Bigelow Paine, his biographer, spoke of him being treated as 'little less than royalty' (LS, 372) on his second English visit in May-October 1873. Twain quickly followed this up with a third trip (November 1873-January 1874) to deliver a further series of lectures. After photographs were taken of him, apparently to go on sale to the general public, he wrote to Olivia that: 'it seems as if3 out of every 5 1 meet on the street recognize me. This in London! It seems incredible' (L5, 532).   What is noteworthy here is just how appreciative a nineteenth-century British audience was of a form of humour that one might assume was culturally alien to it.
