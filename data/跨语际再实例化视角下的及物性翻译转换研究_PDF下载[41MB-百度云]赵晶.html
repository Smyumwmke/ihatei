本书以系统功能语言学的基本理论为指导，把翻译看作一种以源语文本意义为导向的跨语际再实例化过程，强调意义的读解、选择和重构，阐明了选择对译文意义构建的重要性。依托多维度意义模式，借助系统功能语言学的分析工具，以翻译中的及物性转换为例，从跨语际再实例化的视角，对原文和译文的及物性语言特征及其差异进行全面、客观的描述、对比和阐释，详细论证了各类转换对译文意义构建带来的影响，并探究了及物性翻译转换的动因。
根据“形式意义统一律”，形式体现意义，同时意义驱动形式。因此，翻译不仅应“因‘形’得‘意’”，还应“因‘意’构‘形’”。本书还引入了实例化维度中的“耦合”和“意义权重”等概念，并将其整合到翻译研究中，进一步挖掘系统功能语言学应用于翻译研究的理论价值和实践意义，丰富并推动了系统功能翻译研究。
