He called me one morning into his chamber， where he was confined by the gout， and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons， more than a mere wandering inclination， I had for leaving father's house and my native country， where I might be well introduced， and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application and industry， with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand， or of aspiring， superior fortunes on the other， who went abroad upon adventures， to rise by enterprise， and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were all either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state， or what might be called the upper station of low life， which he had found， by long experience， was the best state in the world， the most suited to human happiness， not exposed to the miseries and hardships， the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind， and not embarrassed with the pride， luxury， ambition，　　and envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the happiness of this state by tlus one thing-viz. that this was the state oflife which all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great things， and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes， between the mean and the great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this， as the standard of felicity， when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.　　He bade me observe it， and I should always find that the calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind， but that the middle station had the fewest disasters， and was not exposed　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　本书是作者在59岁时写就的。主人公鲁宾逊本来怀着云游四海的高远志向，越过大西洋和太平洋，在海上做航行。过程中，历经风险。后来整条船在太平洋出了险情，鲁宾逊一人居然奇迹般地活了下来，并只身来到一座荒无人烟的孤岛。绝望中，他忽然得到生命启示，在孤岛上生活了几十年。他在孤岛上劳作生息，开拓荒地，圈养牲畜，种水稻小麦，年复一年与孤独为伴，克服了常人难以克服的困难。他曾与野兽斗智，也曾与吃人肉的野人斗勇。　　曾有哲人说过，作为一个人，首先应该学会的便是如何生存。鲁宾逊并未做出什么惊天动地的事情，而是和我们一样活着。正是这些活着时必需的琐碎细节，成为鲁宾逊同困境对抗的全部过程，而这些困境，则是几乎每个人都曾体会到的：黑暗、饥饿、恐惧、孤独。　　《鲁宾逊漂流记》之所以成为文学史上不朽名著，还在于它的内容的扩张和文字魅力的彰显。在它之前，欧洲的长篇小说大都以帝王将相的业绩或骑士美女的浪漫传奇为主要内容。笛福开始尝试用日常语言，来描写普通人的生活。小说虽属虚构，但对鲁宾逊荒岛生活的描写，逼真而自然，表现了作者非凡的想象力和艺术表现力。此外，小说通篇采用**人称的叙述方式，语言明白晓畅，朴素生动，这一切给作品增添了不少魅力。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　Daniel Defoe （1660 - 24 April 1731） born Daniel Foe， was an English trader， writer， journalist，　　pamphleteer and spy， now most famous for his novel The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe. Defoe is notable for being one of the earliest proponents of the novel， as he helped to popularise the form in Britain， and， along with others such as Samuel Richardson， is among the founders of the English novel. A prolific and versatile writer， he wrote more than 500 books， pamphlets and journals on various topics （including politics， crime， religion， marriage， psychology and the supematural）.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
