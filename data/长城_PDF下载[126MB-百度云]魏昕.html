Traditionally known to the Chineseas the"Long Wall of TenThousand", the massive structure takes advantage of the natural terrain for defensive purposes following the highest points and clinging to ridges. Like a majes dragon, these fortifications offer truly breathtaking views, enhanced by its mountain passes castle gates,and thousands of watch towers and signal beacons along the wall.Justification of the World Heritage Committee:In 220 B.C., under the reign of Qin Shi Huang, sections of earlier fortifications werejoined together to form a united defense system against invasions from the north.Construction continued up to the Ming dynasty （1368-1644）, when the Great Wall be came the world' s largest military structure. Its historic and strategic importance is matched by its architectural significance.</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>简介
