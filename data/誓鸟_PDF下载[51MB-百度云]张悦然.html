在大航海时代的宏大历史背景下，一个美丽的中国女子远下南洋，海啸夺走了她的记忆，她在大海里、岛屿上颠沛流离，被欺侮、被抛弃，历经生育、病痛、牢狱之苦，她刺瞎了自己的双目，只为寻找遗失的记忆。她为了寻找自己的过去，甘愿穷尽一生。春迟终于没能在沧海中找到那枚藏着她的记忆的贝壳，但她并没有把自己的故事归于茫茫。
有人说曾在旧城的废墟瓦砾中，看到过一个眼瞎的女人。她像一只鸟儿一样掠过地上的死人，拾起散落在他们身边或握在他们手中的贝壳。攻进贝壳城邦的那些士兵们，都曾看到这个女人踮着她鲜红的脚掌在坍塌的木梁和死人的身上跳舞。她蒙上患病的儿童的眼睛，引领他们阅读装载着快乐记忆的贝壳，为他们驱除病痛。她被人们视为圣女。她是世上*富有的女人。海盗、歌女、宦官、部族首领、西洋牧师，他们的命运在南洋旖旎的风光里交汇。
The blind woman Chun Chi has a secret. Accompanied only by her The Memory Is So Beautiful That We Will Crash Soul for It adopted son Xiao Xing and a eunuch, she lives in a crumbling house stacked with boxes of seashells. But what does she hope to gain from them? Why does she keep going out to sea? How did she lose her sight? Seeking answers, Xiao Xing goes on a quest to uncover her past, which takes him on a journey far from home and into the jungles of Java. Set in the early fifteenth century, when Ming Emperor Yongle sent fleets of Chinese ships to explore Southeast Asia, entangling the two regions, The Promise Bird flits between the frozen north Chinese winter and the blazing heat of the tropics. An uncompromising novel about devotion that borders on obsession, and a love that tips into madness.
