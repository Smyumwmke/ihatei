I was presentas special envoy of Chinese President Hu Jintao.　　The day was overcast and a mournful drizzle fell. More than 4，000people attended the ceremony，including incumbent president George W.Bush，along with former presidents Clinton，Bush，Ford and Carter，aswell as senior officials and international guests.　　At 11 o’clock，Reagan’s coffin was taken from Capitol Hill to thecathedral，and carried into the hall by eight honor guards. The cofFinwas covered by an American flag. The funeral began as the singing ofthe choirs resonated in the hall. Former British prime minister MargaretThatcher，and Reagan’s vice president and successor George H.W.Bushgave their eulogies，and George W.Bush delivered a memorial speechon behalf of the US government. After the ceremony，the honor guards escorted the coffin to the hearse outside the cathedral，when the cathedral bell rang 40 times to commemorate the 40th president of the US.　　Gazing at Reagan’s coffin，I recalled accompanying him to visit the Terracotta Warriors in Xi’an，and scenes from his legendary life flashed into my mind.　　Reagan was the first US president with an acting background，and the oldest when he was elected. He was hailed as one of the most influential US presidents of the 20th century.　　After assuming the presidency，he pushed ahead with tax reductions and government deregulation，thus stimulating economic growth. Inthe eyes of my American friends，he is a representative of the modern US conservatives who renovated the Republican movement，and whose political philosophy still influences US politics today. His diplomatic policies paved the way for the end of the Cold War. His frank，optimistic and humorous character won him wide support. His rating was 63 percent favorable when he left the White House in 1989，the highest since President Franklin Roosevelt.　　During his tenure，Sino-US relations progressed somewhat erratically.There was “hostility before friendship” to paraphrase the Americans. To win the presidential campaign in 1980，Reagan publicly announced that he would set up an “official liaison” with Taiwan and resume their “official relations”. He also promised to make Taiwan’s defense needs a top priority. This showed that the ideological Reagan of his early presidency was a champion of his “old friends”in Taiwan. Having won the election，he planned to invite Chiang Yen-shih，secretary-general of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang，to his inauguration ceremony，to agree to Taiwan’s opening more offices for the Coordination Council for North American Affairs，and to sell advanced weaponry to Taiwan.　　This represented a severe challenge to Sino-US relations. Deng Xiaoping instructed that a full-scale diplomatic campaign be waged against the US. If China didnt take strong action，more problems would ensue. China must be prepared for a deteriorating situation，that is，regression to the 1973 state ofliaison office，or even to the situation that had prevailed prior to Nixon’s China trip in 1972. Around that time，the Netherlands sold two submarines to Taiwan，and we resolutely downgraded bilateral relations to the level of charge d’affaires. This served as a warning to the US.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>本书这是中国第九任外交部长李肇星的首部外事回忆作品。 通过讲述自己如何从普通农家少年成长为新中国外交官并很终成为外交部长的人生历程，作者首度坦承个人外交生涯中的苦乐酸甜。 通过勾画中国外交的历史脉络，本书抢先发售系统阐释了中国外交布局、本质、原则及新内涵。 通过追忆中美“炸馆事件”、中俄边界谈判、中日围绕历史问题的外交斗争、在联合国的涉台外交斗争等的幕后细节，本书披露了近十年来中国重大外交事件的决策和谈判过程，揭示了历史事件背后的真相。 通过记录作者与各国政要等的私人交往、应对与处理各种外交问题的丰富实践，本书展现了中国外交官的风采，并抢先发售梳理了一代外交人的经验与智慧。 为迎接十九大的召开，本系列邀请知名专家学者撰文，配以轻松的手绘图，从辉煌历程、民主政治、经济改革、文化建设、社会民生等十个主题讲述中国共产党治国理政的新理念新思想新战略。内容很好不错，简明轻松。多语种传播。总书记指出，提高国家文化软实力，关系“两个一百年”奋斗目标和中华民族伟大复兴中国梦的实现。本书立足于讲述中国是如何加强文化软实力建设，弘扬社会主义优选文化，深化文化体制改革，增强人民精神力量，推动社会主义文化大发展大繁荣。 作者以随笔的形式，记录了作者与中国40年的关系，真实记录了中国改革开放40年来，在政治、经济、文化、对外交流方面所发生的巨大变化。书中描述了1978年以及现在的北京、广州等城市的街头场景以及人们的生活状况，还配有一些鲜活的照片，形象生动。同时书中还有一些中日文化交流的细节描述，从侧面反映了中国改革开放所取得的辉煌成就。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
