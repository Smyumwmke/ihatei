　　MY father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.
　　I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister-Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksnuth. As I never saw my father-or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them （for their days were long before the days of photographs）, my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father's, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, "Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,"I drew a cluldish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers ofmine,-who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle,-I am indebted for a beliefl religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence.
　　Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things, seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain that tlus bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and that Plulip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead and buried, and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was ruslung was the sea, and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.
　　"Hold your noise!"cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch. "Keep still, you little devil, or I'll cut your throat!"
　　A fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his leg. A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and tom by briars; who limped, and sluvered, and glared, and growled; and whose teeth
　　chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.
　　"Oh! Don't cut my throat, sir,"I pleaded in terror. "Pray don't do it, sir."
　　"Tell us your name! "said the man. "Quick ! "
　　"Pip, sir."
　　"Once more,"said the man, staring at me. "Give it mouth!"
　　"Pip. Pip, sir."
　　"Show us where you live,"said the man. "Pint out the place!"
　　I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.
　　The man, after looking at me for a moment, tumed me upside down, and emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread. When the church came to itself-for he was so sudden and strong that he made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my feet -when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high tombstone, rembling wlule he ate the bread ravenously.
　　"You young dog,"said the man, licking his lips, "what fat cheeks you ha' got."
　　I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my years, and not strong.
　　"Darn me ifl couldn't eat 'em,"said the man, with a threatening shake of his head, "and ifl han't half a nund to't!"
　　I eamestly expressed my hope that he wouldn't, and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it; partly, to keep myself from crying.
　　"Now then, lookee here!"said the man. "Where's your mother?"

                                        </p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>《远大前程》是狄更斯成熟的作品之一，是他比较晚期的作品。狄更斯经历了丰富的人间生活后，对人，对周围环境，对自己的生活经历都有了深刻的认识，而所有他成熟的思想认识都汇总在《远大前程》一书中。这部作品原题名是Great Expectations，意思是指一笔遗产，中国把它译成“远大前程”。这个译名给读者一种印象，即作品的主人公是有远大前程的。而事实上，这个“远大前程”是带讽刺意义的，应该说这部作品的主题决非仅仅是写孤儿皮普想当上等人的理想幻灭的故事，如果这样理解，就领会错了狄更斯创作这部作品的意义。皮普生活在姐姐家里，生活艰苦，他的理想是当一名像姐夫一样的铁匠，他没有想当上等人。后来他之所以想当上等人是因为环境的改变。狄更斯的哲学思想之一是环境对人思想的影响。不同的环境可以造就成不同的人。皮普的整个发展过程是符合一般人性理论的。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>查尔斯·狄更斯（Charles Dickens）（1812年1870年），英国小说家，出生于海军小职员家庭，10岁时全家被迫迁入负债者监狱，11岁就承担起繁重的家务劳动。曾在黑皮鞋油作坊当童工，15岁时在律师事务所当学徒，后来当上了民事诉讼法庭的审案记录员，接着又担任报社派驻议会的记者。他只上过几年学，全靠刻苦自学和艰辛劳动成为知名作家。 
　　狄更斯是高产作家，他凭借勤奋和天赋创作出一大批经典著作。他又是一位幽默大师，常常用妙趣横生的语言在浪漫和现实中讲述人间真相，狄更斯是19世纪英国现实主义文学的主要代表。艺术上以妙趣横生的幽默、细致入微的心理分析，以及现实主义描写与浪漫主义气氛的有机结合著称。马克思把他和萨克雷等称誉为英国的“一批杰出的小说家”。
