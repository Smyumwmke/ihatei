It is the goal of the series Monographs in Number Theory to publish research monographs and textbooks that provide clear expositions of various  tpoics in number theory .
 We are grateful to Professors Bateman and Diamond for agreeing to include their analytic number theory textbook as the first volume of the series.
We hope to continue to make available advanced monorraphs for reseatchers,as well as monographs and textbooks accessible to a broader audience, including undergarduate students,garduate students,and nonexperts.
