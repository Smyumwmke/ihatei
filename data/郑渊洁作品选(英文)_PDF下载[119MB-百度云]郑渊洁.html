He knew that living well meant owning a car. To achieve this goal， he had been among the best students until the first year of college.　　After entering college， he thought that he could just relax. He tried to master the BASIC computer language in primary school， but it became useless in middle school. Computer had turned into an easy-to-use home appliance， like a TV set. He believed the most useful courses were health and sex education. One might never need math-ematics or sciences in their entire life， but health and sex education　　coarse were useful for everyone and could make his life a happy one.　　It was a pity however that the course was only a small part of the school curriculum.　　Li went to study English in a foreign language college because he wanted to find a job in a foreign company.　　After graduation， Li Hongzhi got his wish fulfilled and started working for a well-known foreign company. After going through a year ofpainful probation period， he finally knew how to communicate with foreigners. He knew it was hard to get a promotion in a large company， so he used his large company experience to find another job in a small foreign company. He quickly received recognition in the new company and was promoted to marketing manager in two years， and his salary rose from 1，500 yuan to 15，000 yuan per month.　　Li's job was to help foreign products enter the Chinese market and compete with similar products in China. The ultimate goal was to crush the China-made products and dominate the market.　　Li Hongzhi did well in his job until one day when he saw the word “comprador” in the Modern Chinese Dictionary. He then decided to quit. By the way， he already had enough savings to buy a car.　　His foreign boss was very surprised at his resignation.　　“Why?” asked the boss.　　“I don't want to be a comprador，” said Li.　　“You don't want to be what?” the boss didn't know this word.　　Li didn't explain.　　“What's your plan?”　　“To help the Chinese products compete with foreign ones.”　　Watching the man who deserted him walk out， the boss muttered，“China is about to be very strong... to be very strong……”　　Li Hongzhi， with the money earned from his foreign boss， walked into a car dealership and drove out in a “Persian cat，” something he had wanted for a long time.　　……</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
