  插图：This task is to cultivate students' ability to make coherent utterances. To lower thelevel of difficulty, two measures are taken: first, they've got the chance to speak with otherstudents and have made necessary preparation; second, the recording provides anotherchance for them to listen to what is actually already quite familiar to them.   Play the recording 2-3 times. For the 2nd playing, pause for a while after each sentenceto allow students time to take notes. Tell them to jot down key words only. Then havesome of them report what they've heard to the class. The teacher may also tell students tomake a presentation of what they have prepared by themselves.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
