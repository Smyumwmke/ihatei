<p>书名:钢铁企业自备电厂机组配置优化.煤气系统优化调度</p><p>作者:孟华, 著</p><p>页数:0</p><p>定价:¥45.0</p><p>出版社:西南交通大学出版社</p><p>出版日期:2018-11-01</p><p>ISBN:9787564365547</p><p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>本书运用数学模型结合富余煤气的自身特性对自备电厂煤气系统进行预测及调度，对发展钢铁生产、降低能源消耗和产品成本是一种强有力的手段和途径，具有重要的理论意义和现实意义。综合考虑煤气放散和机组运行效率下降对整个煤气系统价值的影响，建立自备电厂机组配置优化模型；考虑到依靠人工经验无法对其煤气供入量进行准确预测，针对煤气供入量特性，建立自备电厂煤气供入量预测模型。在预测模型的基础上从煤气系统全局出发，以总运行成本很小为目标，考虑锅炉负荷波动频繁的特点，建立优化调度模型。为此，本书将所建模型应用于实际钢铁企业自备电厂，从系统和全局视角出发研讨了钢铁企业自备电厂机组配置优化、煤气优化调度问题，丰富了钢铁企业自备电厂煤气系统预测、优化、调度问题的研究方法，以期为钢铁企业自备电厂煤气系统提供理论与方法上的指导。本书可作为生产过程物流专业及相关专业的通用教材，也可供相关方向科研人员、企业在职人员培训使用。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
