This theory provides new scientific answers to the major questions of what kind of development China should achieve in a new environment and how the country should achieve it. It represents a new level of our understanding of the laws of socialism with Chinese characteristics and reaches a new realm in the development of Marxism in contemporary China. These elaborate the emergence, questions to be answered, new level and new realm of the thought.　　The other five sentences: The Scientific Outlook on Development is the latest achievement in developing the system of theories of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and it is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China and a powerful theoretical weapon for guiding all the work of the Party and country. Together with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three Represents, the Scientific Outlook on Development is the theoretical guidance the Party must adhere to for the foreseeable future. These emphasize that the thought is the latest achievement, crystallization of collective wisdom, theoretical weapon and theoretical guidance.　　Among the 10 sentences, only the second sentence was put forward in the report to the 17th National Congress, and the others were all newly added. Some of the sentences are similar to the evaluation of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three Represents.　　At the Seventh Plenary Session of the 17th CPC Central Committee, Xi Jinping said since being put forward in 2003, the Scientific Outlook on Development has experienced a process of repeated practice and understanding. The CPC Central Committee has been constantly testing and enriching the Scientific Outlook on Development when implementing the thought. Particularly after the 17th National Congress, it has been proved to be correct and effective.　　Thus, conditions were ripe for the Scientific Outlook on Development to be defined as a guiding thought of the Party at the 18th National Congress. The new status of the Scientific Outlook on Development was a result of constant practice, theoretical development and public support.　　Defining the Scientific Outlook on Development as a guiding thought of the Party was to better guide the long-term practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, the 18th National Congress required that "We must apply it throughout the course of modernization and to every aspect of Party building."　　Based on the definition of connotation of the Scientific Outlook on Development by the 17th National Congress, the 18th National Congress required the whole Party to work "more purposefully" in four aspects: The whole Party must more purposefully make promoting economic and social development the top priority in applying the Scientific Outlook on Development; the whole Party must more purposefully take putting people first as the core requirement for thoroughly applying the Scientific Outlook on Development; the whole Party must more purposefully make pursuing comprehensive, balanced and sustainable development the basic requirement for applying the Scientific Outlook on Development; and the whole Party must more purposefully take the holistic approach as the fundamental way of thoroughly applying the Scientific Outlook on Development.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《走向未来的中国与世界（英文版）》由中共党史研究专家撰写，介绍了中国共产党的政治信仰；中国面临的十大机遇与挑战；中国与世界发展共同蕴涵的深层逻辑机制；中国未来发展的方向、道路和战略；做好中国特色社会主义这篇大文章；以更大的勇气和智慧全面深化改革；中国应有自己的全球战略；呼唤建立国际文明新秩序；提高中国话语体系的科学化大众化国际化水平；进一步提高治国理政的领导水平；提高党的建设科学化水平等方面的内容。通过《走向未来的中国与世界（英文版）》，读者可以更好地了解中国共产党的治国方略和中国的未来发展方向。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
