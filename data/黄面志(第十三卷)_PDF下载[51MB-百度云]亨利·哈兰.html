You can't pretend that red-haired women are the same."　　"The same, with the addition of a little henna," the pale young man argued wearily.　　"It may surprise you to learn that I was th inking of red-haired women who are born red-haired," his friend' remarked, from an altitude.　　"ln that case," said he, "l admit there is a difference-they have white eyelashes."  And he emptied his glass of green stuff. "Is all this Apropos of boots ? "  he questioned.　　The other regarded him solemnly. "lt's apropos of your immortal soul," be answered, nodding his head.  "lt's medicine for a mind diseased.   The only thing that will wake you up, and put a little life and human nature in you, is alove-afFair with a red-haired woman.  Red in the hair means fire in the heart. It means all sorts of things.   If you really wish to please me, Uncle, you'll go and fall in  ove with a red-haired woman."　　The younger man, whom the elder addressed as Uncle, sbrugged his shoulders, and gave a little snitl.  Then he lighted a cigarette.　　The elder man left the table, and wen, to the open window. " Heavens, what weather ! " he exclaimed fervently,  " The day is made of perfumed velvet.  The air is a love-philtre.  The whole world sings romance.  And yet you-insensible monster l ——you can sit there torpidly——"  But abruptly he fell silent. His attention bad been caught by something below, in the garden.  He watched it for an instant from his place by the window; then he stepped forth upon the balcony, still watching. Suddenly, facing half-way round, "By my bauble, Nunky," he called to his companion, and his voice was tense with surprised cxultancy, "she's got red hair ! "　　The younger man looked up with vague eyes. "Who? What ? " he asked languidly.　　"Come here, come here," his friend urged, beckoning him. "There," he indicated, when the pale man had joined him, "below there-to tbe.right-picking roses.  She's got red hair. She's sent by Providence."　　A woman in a white frock was picking roses~ in one of the alleys of the garden ; rather a tall woman.   Her back was turned towards her observers ,  but she wore only a light scarf of lace over her head, and her hair——soft-brown, fawn-colour, in its shadows-where the sun touched it, showed a soul of red.　　The younger man frowned, and asked sharply, " Who the devil is she ? "　　"I don't know, Pm sure," replied the other. "One of the Queen's women, probably.  But whoever she is, she's got red hair."　　The younger man frowned more fiercely still.  " What is she doing in the King's private garden ?  This is a pretty state of things."   He stamped his foot angrily.  " Go down and turn her out. And I wish measures to be taken, that such trespassing may not occur again."　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　本书为《黄面志》靠前3卷。《黄面志》一书，美国小说家、编辑哈兰（Henry Harland，1861-1905，）编选。是文学季刊的合印本。原以“黄色年代”为名，自1884年4月创刊到1887年春停刊，共13期。它引领英国19世纪末20世纪初文坛风潮，包含宽广的文化和艺术体裁：诗歌、短片小说、随笔、插图、画像和画作复件。有名英国画家比亚兹莱（Aubrey Beardsley，1872-1898）为其创作了若干期封面。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
