Yang Changwei、Zhang Jingyu、Lian Jing、 Yu Wenying、Zhang Jianjing编*的《Slope  Earthquake Stability(精)》This book begins  with the dynamic characteristics of the  covering layer-bedrock type slope,  containing monitoring data of the seismic  array, shaking table tests, numerical  analysis and theoretical derivation. Then it  focuses on the landslide mechanism and  assessment method. It also proposes a model  that assessing the hazard area based on the  field investigations. Many questions,  exercises and solutions are given.  Researchers and engineers in the field of  Geotechnical Engineering and Anti-seismic  Engineering can benefit from it.
